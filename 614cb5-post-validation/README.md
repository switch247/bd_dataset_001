# project template

Starter scaffold for bd dataset task.

## Structure
- repository_before/: baseline code (`__init__.py`)
- repository_after/: optimized code (`__init__.py`)
- tests/: test suite (`__init__.py`)
- evaluation/: evaluation scripts (`evaluation.py`)
- instances/: sample/problem instances (JSON)
- patches/: patches for diffing
- trajectory/: notes or write-up (Markdown)

---

## Template Instructions
> **Note:** The task gen team should delete this section after creating the task.

### Setup Steps

1. **Create a directory** with the format: `uuid-task_title`
   - Task title words should be joined by underscores (`_`)
   - UUID and task title should be joined with a dash (`-`)
   - Example: `5g27e7-My_Task_Title`

2. **Update `instances/instance.json`** — the following fields are empty by default; fill in appropriate values:
   - `"instance_id"`
   - `"problem_statement"`
   - `"github_url"`

3. **Update `.gitignore`** to reflect your language and library setup

4. **Add `reports/` inside `evaluation/` to `.gitignore`**
   - Each report run should be organized by date/time

---

## Reports Generation
> **Note:** The developer should delete this section after completing the task before pushing to GitHub.

When the evaluation command is run, it should generate reports in the following structure:

```
evaluation/
└── reports/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD/
        └── HH-MM-SS/
            └── report.json
```

### Report Schema

```json
{
  "run_id": "uuid",
  "started_at": "ISO-8601",
  "finished_at": "ISO-8601",
  "duration_seconds": 0.0,
  "environment": {
    "python_version": "3.x",
    "platform": "os-arch"
  },
  "before": {
    "tests": {},
    "metrics": {}
  },
  "after": {
    "tests": {},
    "metrics": {}
  },
  "comparison": {},
  "success": true,
  "error": null
}
```

The developer should add any additional metrics and keys that reflect the runs (e.g., data seeded to test the code on before/after repository).

## Final README Contents
> **Note:** Replace the template content above with the following sections before pushing:

1. **Problem Statement**
2. **Prompt Used**
3. **Requirements Specified**
4. **Commands:**
   - Commands to spin up the app and run tests on `repository_before`
   - Commands to run tests on `repository_after`
   - Commands to run `evaluation/evaluation.py` and generate reports
   
   > **Note:** For full-stack app tasks, the `repository_before` commands will be empty since there is no app initially.

# Project Test & Evaluation Commands

This project uses a unified test and evaluation setup to compare two codebases (`repository_before` and `repository_after`) using the same external test suite. All commands are run from the project root and leverage Docker for reproducibility.

## Commands


### 1. Run Tests on `repository_before`
`docker compose run --rm test-before`

### 2. Run Tests on `repository_after`
`docker compose run --rm test-after`

### 3. Run Evaluation and Generate Reports
`docker compose run --rm evaluate`

## Docker Setup

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines three services:

- `test-before`: Runs tests on the `repository_before` codebase
- `test-after`: Runs tests on the `repository_after` codebase
- `evaluate`: Runs the evaluation/report script

All services mount the project root and node_modules for fast builds and reproducible results.

## Notes

- Make sure your test suite and evaluation script use the `TEST_TARGET` environment variable to switch between before/after codebases.
- You can run all commands either with Docker Compose (recommended for consistency) or directly with npm if your environment is set up.

## Example Workflow

1. Run tests on both codebases:
  ```sh
  docker compose run --rm test-before
  docker compose run --rm test-after
  ```
2. Run evaluation and generate reports:
  ```sh
  docker compose run --rm evaluate
  ```
